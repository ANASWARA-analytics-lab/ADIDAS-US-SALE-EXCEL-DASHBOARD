# ADIDAS-US-SALE-EXCEL-DASHBOARD
Interactive Excel dashboard analyzing Adidas US sales performance by month, region, product, sales method, and retailer with key KPls for total sales and profit.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes Adidas US sales performance across multiple dimensions. It consolidates raw transactional data into key KPIs such as total sales and total profit, then visualizes them using dynamic charts for months, regions, products, sales methods, and retailers. Slicers for month, year, region, and sales method allow users to filter the entire report, making it easy for business stakeholders to identify top‑performing areas, spot trends over time, and support data‑driven decisions on marketing, inventory, and channel strategy.

# Business problems
-Lack of a single view of total sales and profit across the US, making it hard for managers to track overall performance. 
-Limited visibility into how different sales channels (in-store, online, outlet) contribute to revenue and profitability. 
-Difficulty identifying high- and low-performing regions, products, and retailers for targeted decision-making. 
-No easy way to monitor monthly and daily trends, causing delays in reacting to demand changes or seasonality. 
-Operational efficiency by product category is unclear, making it hard to optimize resources and reduce costs. 

# Business goals

--- Enable comparison of performance by channel, region, product, and retailer to highlight growth opportunities. 
--- Help managers quickly spot trends, peaks, and drops in sales and profit over months and days.

# HOW TO OPEN AND THE VERSION NEEDED

--- This dashboard file should be opened with Microsoft Excel on a desktop or laptop, not in a limited web/mobile viewer.
--- Recommend Excel 2016 or later (including Office 2019, Office 2021, or Microsoft 365), because these versions fully support slicers, modern charts, and advanced formatting used in dashboards.
--- To open it: download the file from GitHub, right‑click and choose “Open with → Microsoft Excel” (or double‑click it if Excel is your default), then enable “Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” if any      security warning appears so that slicers and formulas work correctly.
